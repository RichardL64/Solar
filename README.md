Solis inverter / Pylontech battery arduino integration for remote panel etc outside the cloud
The inverter and batteries expose RS485 integration potential.

Avoiding Raspberry PI solutions due to current unavailability and trying to minimise solution complexity


Intention:

Solis inverter RS485/Modbus integration with Arduino Nano 33 IOT micro webserver
Provide local network access to the Solis registers over HTTP/Simple web pages

Facilitate local physical, moving coil, meter readouts for key measures.
